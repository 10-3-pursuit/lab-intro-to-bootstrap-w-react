# Bootstrap classes used

1. **`<main className="container">`**:
   - `container`: This is a fundamental class in Bootstrap that centers your content horizontally and provides a responsive fixed-width container. It adjusts the maximum width of the content at different breakpoints (screen sizes).

2. **`<nav className="navbar navbar-expand-lg">`**:
   - `navbar`: Styles the navigation bar with a default flexible and responsive design.
   - `navbar-expand-lg`: Specifies that the navbar should expand (collapsible elements are shown) on large screens (and above).

3. **`<div className="container-fluid">`**:
   - `container-fluid`: Similar to `container`, but for a full-width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport at all breakpoints.

4. **`<button className="navbar-toggler">`**:
   - `navbar-toggler`: Styles the button as a navbar toggle, typically used for collapsing and expanding the navbar on smaller screens.

5. **`<h1 className="text-center my-4">`**:
   - `text-center`: Centers text horizontally within the element.
   - `my-4`: Adds a margin to the top and bottom of the element (Y-axis), with a size of 4 (Bootstrap's spacing scale).

6. **`<div className="search-bar d-flex mb-3">`**:
   - `search-bar`: This is not a Bootstrap class, likely a custom class for additional specific styling.
   - `d-flex`: Applies the flexbox layout to the element, making its children laid out flexibly.
   - `mb-3`: Adds a margin to the bottom of the element with a size of 3.

7. **`<input className="form-control me-2">`**:
   - `form-control`: Styles form elements like `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` with Bootstrapâ€™s own theme, improving the default form appearance.
   - `me-2`: Adds a margin to the end (right margin in left-to-right languages) of the element with a size of 2.

8. **`<button className="btn btn-secondary">`**:
   - `btn`: This is a basic Bootstrap class for styling button elements.
   - `btn-secondary`: Applies the secondary Bootstrap color theme to the button.

9. **`<div className="row">`**:
   - `row`: A Bootstrap grid system class that works as a wrapper for columns (`col-*` classes). It ensures proper alignment and distribution of space among columns.

10. **`<div className="col-md-4 mb-3">`**:
    - `col-md-4`: Defines a column that spans 4 out of the total 12 columns in the Bootstrap grid system, starting from the medium breakpoint.
    - `mb-3`: Adds a margin to the bottom of the element with a size of 3.

11. **`<img className="img-fluid">`**:
    - `img-fluid`: Makes the image responsive by setting its max-width to 100% and height to auto, ensuring it scales correctly on all screen sizes.

12. **`<button className="btn btn-primary">`**:
    - `btn`: Basic Bootstrap button styling.
    - `btn-primary`: Applies the primary Bootstrap color theme to the button.

13. **`<table className="table">`**:
    - `table`: Applies Bootstrap's basic styling to the `<table>` element, improving its appearance with minimal, neat styling.
